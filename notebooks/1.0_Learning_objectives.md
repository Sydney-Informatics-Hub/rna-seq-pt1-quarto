<div class="questions">

### **Questions**

What are the main learning objectives for Day 1?

</div>  

<div class="objectives">

### **Objectives**

Get acquainted with the learning objectives for Day 1.

</div>  


Today, we will get introduced to the first steps of analysing RNA sequencing data using the command line - which includes how to pre-process raw sequencing reads to analysis ready count data.
We will be lookig into the following main topics of interest - 

### **RNA-Seq**
- What is RNA-Seq?
- What are the main applications of RNA-Seq
- How does a basic RNA-seq workflow look like?
- What is the experimental case-study for this workshop?

### **A specific case-study using RNA-Seq**
- Knockout mouse model to study Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS)
- What is the Experimental question?
- What does the experiment design look like?

### **Steps involved in differential expression analysis**
- Check sequencing read quality
- Trimming seqeuncing reads 
- Alignment against the reference genome
- Generate the gene-count matrix
- Differential expression analysis (Day2)
- Functional interpretation        (Day2)

### **Describe the benefits of using nf-core workflows**
- A typical bioinformatics workflow.
- Nextflow as a workflow management systems, how does it help?
- Use nfcore’s rnaseq pipeline to transform raw sequencing data into analysis ready count data.

### **Deploy the nf-core workflow on Pawsey’s Nimbus VM**
- What is the core nfcore-rnaseq command?
- What are the main inputs?
- What are the main outputs? 
- Can we add/remove/change the tools/parameters used for the various processes?
- What do we carry forward to DAY 2: The gene-count matrix

### Key points

- We will use the nextflow `nfcore-rnaseq` pipeline to convert raw reads to gene-counts.
- We will run the `nfcore-rnaseq` pipeline on a `Pawsey’s Nimbus VM instance`.
