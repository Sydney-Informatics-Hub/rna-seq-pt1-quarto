# **Helpful logs**


<div class="questions">

### **Questions**

- What information does the timeline log file provide us?
- How can we estimate the CPU/memory resource requirements?
- What were the main observations and possible limitations when running the pipeline?
</div>  

<div class="objectives">

### **Objectives**

- Understand the timelines for multiple processes
- Estimate the resource requirements for multiple processes
- Analysing the technical requirements to run nf-core pipelines

</div>  

# **MultiQC**
- [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) is a modular tool to aggregate results from bioinformatics analyses across many samples into a single report.
- Here, MultiQC searches the `results` directory for analysis logs and compiles a HTML report summarising the output from multiple tools run by the `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline.

<div class="challenge">
### **Challenge**
It is a very useful practice to look into the MultiQC logs but a challenge in itself :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: ! 
</div>  


# **Nextflow logs**

## **Workflow timeline**

![](/fig/timeline.png)

- Different processing times for different tools.
- Each process can be assigned specifc resources using a nextflow.config file.
- Nextflow parallises runs of multiple samples for specific processes depending on the available rersources; This step can thus get constrained by available resources (CPUs/memory) on the resource (here Nimbus VM).


## **Compute resource usage**
![](/fig/cpu_usage.png)

- Shows multiple graphical statistics displaying the resource usage for various processes in the run.
- This helps to get an estimate of the required resources for independant processes and assign them for future runs.

<div class="keypoints">

### **Key points**
- Nextflow provides easy to understand html log files, which can be used to understand the system resource requirement and hence planning for future big runs.
