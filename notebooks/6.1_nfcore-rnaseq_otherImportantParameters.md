This section introduces the user to the important nfcore-rnaseq parameters


#### Samplesheet sequence data
- We need a [samplesheet](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.7/usage#samplesheet-input) with information about the samples you would like to analyse.
- If the samplesheet is located in a different folder, you can use this parameter to specify its path. 

![The samplesheet](/fig/elaborate_samplesheet.png)

- The samplesheet is a comma-separated file with 4 columns, and a header row as shown in the example samplesheet above. 
- The pipeline will auto-detect whether a sample is single- or paired-end using the information provided in the samplesheet. 
- The samplesheet can have as many columns as you desire, however, there is a strict requirement for the first 4 columns to match those defined in the table below.

<div class="challenge">

### Challenge #2


```default
- The samplesheet which we will be using for today's hands-on is already created and placed in the folder `~/base_directory/working_directory`.
- Can you open this file using the utility `vi` and figure out what is the difference between ours and the one shown as a sample above?
```
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```default
- The samplesheet above consists of both single- and paired-end data. It is for 6 samples, where TREATMENT_REP3 has been sequenced twice.
- The samplesheet to be used in today's analysis is a lot simpler, with only single-end reads. 
```
</details>
</div>  



- However one thing we can check ourselves as a task, is the **strandedness** of the read library.




#### Other input/output options
```default
--input   Path to comma-separated file containing information about the samples.
--outdir  The output directory where the results will be saved.
```

#### Reference genome options
```default
--genome            Name of iGenomes reference. 
--star_index        Path to directory or tar.gz archive for pre-built STAR index.
--hisat2_index      Path to directory or tar.gz archive for pre-built HISAT2 index.
--save_reference    If generated by the pipeline save the STAR index in the results directory.
```

#### Alignment options
```default
--aligner           Alignment algorithm to use.
--pseudo_aligner    Pseudo aligner to use.
```

#### Process skipping/use-alternate options
```default
# There is a rds file created which can then be used further?
# Also check which/where are DESeq2 PCA and heatmap plotting created?
# Check results of nfcore-rnaseq in details

```

```default
--deseq2_vst      Use vst transformation instead of rlog with DESeq2.
--skip_fastqc     Skip FastQC.
--skip_multiqc    Skip MultiQC.
```

### Key points

- A single nfcore command can be run for the complete workflow excecution.
- nfcore provides high flexibility to use alternative tools for a step in the rnaseq pipeline.
- nfcore provides high flexibility when allowing to skip non-madatory steps in the rnaseq pipeline.
