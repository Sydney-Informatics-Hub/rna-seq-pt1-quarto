### **Objectives**

- Recap Day 1: nf-core/rnaseq pipeline

</div>  

<![The samplesheet](/fig/typical_and_nfcore_merged.png)

- What is RNA sequencing and what are the main applications of RNA-seq?
- How does it help to analyze RNA-seq data using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline?
- How to run the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline on the Pawsey Nimbus VM?
- What are the important features of the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline?
- What next, using the gene-count matrix?




**Notes**   
<sup id="f1">1[â†©](#a1)</sup> Here is a list of ['nf-core pipelines'](https://nf-co.re/pipelines/).

### **Key points**

- We generated a gene-count matrix using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, using a single command.
- The gene-count matrix will be used today for identifying differentially expressed genes.
