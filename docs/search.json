    "text": "In part 1 of this workshop series, we will introduce you to the data pre-processing pipeline for bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using the command line. To perform differential gene expression analysis, we first need to process raw sequence data to generate a gene count matrix that represents gene expression levels. To do this, we will run the nf-core/rnaseq Nextflow pipeline on Pawsey‚Äôs Nimbus Cloud.\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

The course is beginner friendly and intended for those interested in using the command line interface for their analysis. It is also suitable for those who want to learn about and use nf-co.re workflows."

The second part of the series uses R/R Studio on Pawsey Nimbus Cloud to perform differential expression and pathway analysis using raw count data generated in part 1.\nWe recommend attending both courses if you would like an end-to-end overview of how to perform the analysis. If you are only interested in the technologies used, you may be able to get away with attending only the parts of interest."

We‚Äôll still be working on Nimbus, but instead of working on the command line, we‚Äôll be using R/RStudio.\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"
