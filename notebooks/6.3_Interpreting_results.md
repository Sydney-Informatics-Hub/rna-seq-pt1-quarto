# **Interpreting the results**


<div class="questions">

### **Questions**

- What are the main biological results generated?
- How to best view and interpret the results?
</div>  

<div class="objectives">

### **Objectives**

- View and interpret the various biological results
- Streamline the results interpretation prcoess
</div>  

### **How to view and interpret the results** 

The results are stored in the folder 'results' with sub-folders for individual steps. It should resemble:
```default
drwxrwxr-x  2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jul 26 06:53 pipeline_info
drwxrwxr-x 19 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jul 26 06:53 star_salmon
drwxrwxr-x  3 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jul 26 06:44 trimgalore
drwxrwxr-x  2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jul 26 06:43 fastqc
drwxrwxr-x  3 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jul 25 20:51 multiqc
```

* X11 Forwarding would be the best way to provide the user with a streamlined approach to interpret and proceed on the same platform.
* It should also assist the user with essential steps such as : 
   - Visualising the multiple html log files
   - Using common bioinformatics tools such as IGV viewer etc.
   - Other GUI based applications without resorting to transfer of the files back and forth across platforms.
* The alternate option is to identify and download certain result-files to local PC.
* Since X11 Forwarding is not working on the Nimbus instance, we will use the second option.

On your local machine, please use the following scp command for transferring the "results" folder 
```default
scp -r `login_name`@###.###.###.###:PATH_TO_results_FOLDER/results ./
```

### **Intepreting the biological results**
- **FastQC**: Quality assessment and trimming

- **Alignment**: Map the sequenced reads against a (Huge) reference (organism) sequence  to identify the genes to which they belong.

- **Count data**: For gene expression in Part II

- **Principal component analysis (PCA) plot**: A two dimensional view of the multi-dimensional gene signatures

<div class="keypoints">

### **Key points**
- Nexyflow can download the required software containers as well as genome resource databases in run-time, if we are working with standard model organisms such as human, mouse etc.
- The nfcore-rnaseq pipeline generates independant sub-folders in the main `results` folder for individual processes 
- The outputs can be transferred to the local machine and viewed for further analysis.
