Training will be delivered online, so you will need access to a modern computer with a stable internet connection and around 5GB of storage space for data downloaded prior to the course. Participants are encouraged to setup a Python environment on their local computer (as per the Setup Instructions provided), but participation using other platforms/environments can be supported where necessary."

We will try and get these uploaded to this site as soon as possible. Please interrupt whenever you want! Ideally, have your camera on and interact as much as possible. There will be someone monitoring the chat-window with any questions you would like to post there. Four hours is a long Zoom session so we have plenty of scheduled breaks combined with a mix of content to be delivered as demos, plus sections as independent exercises, but most of the course will be pretty-hands on with everyone writing their own code. We will use Zoom break-out rooms as needed with the Trainers and participants."

Real bioinformatics samples for RNASeq are in the range of few GB. Many bioinformatics tools can use multiple CPUs and quite a few also display high memory requirements.\nStoring big reference databases for re-use: Resources such as “cvmfs” will be ideal for storing big sized reference datasets in central repostories.\nStoring most recent version of the ’nf-core software; as backup: Although it is recommended to download the latest version of a nf-core pipeline, it was observed that the most recent version of nf-core/rnaseq displayed errors. So we are hosting a near recent copy of the pipeline from the “cvmfs”. Since (possibly) minor changes are observed between sub-versions of nf-core pipelines, this approach can be used as an effective alternative.\nStoring singularity containers in cvmfs!!: Need to weigh the pros and cons! - Also, this is directly dependant on whether we download the nf-core pipeline on the fly (or use an older version)…\nX11 Forwarding: The analysis can be streamlined if the user is able to visualise and run GUI based applications on the Vm instances.\n\n\n\nKey points\n\nNextflow provides easy to understand html log files, which can be used to understand the system resource requirement and hence planning for future big runs."
