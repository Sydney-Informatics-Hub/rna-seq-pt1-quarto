# **Differential expression RNA-seq workflow overview**

<div class="questions">

### **Questions** {.unlisted}

- What are the different steps in a typical RNA-seq differential expression (DE) pipeline?
- What steps does the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline perform?

Now that we've learned about the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, let's think about where this pipeline sits within the broader experimental method. Remember we're processing our RNA-seq reads so that we can identify differentially expressed genes and perform pathway enrichment analysis.

#### Revisit the aims of the case study!
The aim of our RNA-seq experiment is to determine which genes are differentially expressed between our two conditions of interest in our mice. We are then asking if the differences in expression between *Gtf2ird1* knockout mice and normal (wildtype) mice can provide clues as to the underlying mechanisms involved in Williams-Beuren syndrome.

In order to identify differentially expressed genes between these groups, we need to perform multiple steps that convert those raw sequence reads to analysis-ready data. We discussed the strucutre of this workflow and the various processes that are performed by nf-core/rnaseq pipeline earlier today. **Can you use what you learned from those discussions to do the challenge exercise below?**

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}
Here are all the steps that make up a typical differential expression workflow when we're working with bulk RNA-seq data. Can you place the steps in the right order?

HINT: Start with the data given to you by a sequencing company and finish with the process you'd use to link expression differences with the phenotype of interest.

## **What steps does the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline perform?**

The nf-core/rnaseq pipeline is designed to handle data processing steps that can easily be standardised and automated. It is used to process the raw sequence reads and generate read count data that we will be analysing tomorrow. These steps are often the most computationally challenging to perform. 

Looking back up at the challenge exercise above can you recall some of the tools nf-core offers to perform the following steps?

1. Raw reads quality control 
2. Read trimming 
3. Trimmed read quality control 
4. Read alignment 

By now our nf-core/rnaseq command should have finished. Lets move on to the next part of the workshop, where we'll look at all the files and results generated by the pipeline. Open your terminal window again to check its finished running and proceed to the next lesson: [What is nf-core/rnaseq doing? > The results](). **GS- add links here once finalised**

### **Key points** {.unlisted}

- The main steps of a differential expression RNA-seq pipeline include quality control of raw data, alignment to a reference genome, measuring read counts associated with genes, differential gene expression analysis, and functional interpretation. 
- The nf-core/rnaseq pipeline can be used to align raw sequence reads to a reference genome and generate read count data.
