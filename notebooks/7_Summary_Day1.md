### **Objectives**

- Recap Day 1: nfcore-rnaseq pipeline

</div>  

<![The samplesheet](/fig/typical_and_nfcore_merged.png)

- What is RNA sequencing and what are the main applications of RNA-seq?
- How does it help to analyze RNA-seq data using the nfcore-rnaseq pipeline?
- How to run the nfcore-rnaseq pipeline on the Pawsey Nimbus VM?
- What are the important features of the nfcore-rnaseq pipeline?
- What next, using the gene-count matrix?




**Notes**   
<sup id="f1">1[â†©](#a1)</sup> Here is a list of ['nfcore pipelines'](https://nf-co.re/pipelines/).

### **Key points**

- We generated a gene-count matrix using the nfcore-rnaseq pipeline, using a single command.
- The gene-count matrix will be used today for identifying differentially expressed genes.
