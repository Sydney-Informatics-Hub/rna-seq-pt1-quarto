# **nf-core/rnaseq results**

<div class="questions">

### **Questions**{.unlisted}

- How are the results from the nf-core/rnaseq organised?
- How can I transfer the results from Nimbus to my local computer?

Lets start by checking that the nf-core/rnaseq command has completed. Bring up the terminal window you left your command running in. If your run was successful, your terminal should display a Pipeline completed successfully message, same as the image below:

![](../fig/completed_nfcore_rnaseq_run.png)

The pipeline completion message tells us some useful information including when the run finished, how long it took to run, and how many CPU hours it consumed. If you scroll up in your terminal, you'll see just how many processes were run, and can confirm they all ran successfully so long as they all show **100%** completion on the right side of each process line.

If any of these processes failed, the pipeline will stop and print an error message to the screen telling you which process failed. A nice feature of Nextflow is the option to resume the running of a workflow from the last completed process (`-resume`), if for any reason the workflow stops prematurely. 

### **The results directory** 

Lets take a look at the results output by the pipeline. Remember that we told the nf-core/rnaseq run command to output all results to a directory named 'results' using the `--outdir` flag. 

To view the contents of the results folder in your terminal, run:

```default
ls -lh results
``` 
It should return a list of directories like this: 

```default
drwxrwxr-x  2 training training 4.0K Sep 19 03:35 fastqc
drwxrwxr-x  3 training training 4.0K Sep 19 03:55 multiqc
drwxrwxr-x  2 training training 4.0K Sep 19 03:56 pipeline_info
drwxrwxr-x 19 training training 4.0K Sep 19 03:55 star_salmon
drwxrwxr-x  3 training training 4.0K Sep 19 03:35 trimgalore
```

Each of these directories contains results and files generated by various stages of the pipeline for each sample. We're going to go through these directories one by one as we talk through the stages run by the pipeline.

## MultiQC output logs

One thing we won't have time to discuss today is the MultiQC reports. [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) is a great tool for reporting summary metrics for many  different bioinformatic tools. In our nf-core/rnaseq run, MultiQC has searched the `results` directory for analysis logs and compiles an .html report for each tool.

### **Copy the results folder to your local machine**

**GS- this section needs to be adjusted, they dont need to download bams**

Some of the files the pipeline generated are in `.html` format which cannot view in the terminal so we will copy them to our local computer and use our web browsers to view them. 

Transferring the files from Nimbus to your local computer can be done using the scp command by Mac and Linux users. For Windows users your scp command will vary depending on the way your computer is set up. Demonstrators will supply participants with a link to a prepared results folder. 

For those who wish to try out the scp command, open a new terminal window. **Do not** log in to Nimbus. Navigate to the path of your choice on your local computer by running: 

```default
cd /path/to/directory
```

Use the following command for transferring the results folder from Nimbus to this local path:

```default
scp -r `login_name`@###.###.###.###:~/base_directory/working_directory/results ./
```

We can now use a web browser on our computers to open the html reports. We're going to investigate the files and results produced by the pipeline as we step through the workflow run by the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, starting with the raw sequence data quality checks. 

Proceed to the next lesson: [What is nf-core/rnaseq doing? > Raw sequencing data QC](). **GS- add links here once finalised** 

<div class="keypoints">

### **Key points**{.unlisted}
- The nf-core/rnaseq pipeline generates independant sub-folders in the main results folder for individual processes run by the pipeline.
- The name of the results folder can be customised using the `--outdir` flag.
- Some of the results files like quality control reports from FastQC and MultiQC are in html format and can't be viewed using your terminal.
